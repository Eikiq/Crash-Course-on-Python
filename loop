#Q1Write a script that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. 
Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7. Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7.

for x in range(0,100):
 if x%7==0:   #注意indented
  print(x)    #注意indented
  
#Question 2
Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n. 
Then, print the first 10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number. 
Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all integers before it. 
For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1*2*3*4*5=120. Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1.
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for x in range(1,n):
        result =result*n
        n=n-1
    return result

for n in range(0,10):
    print(n, factorial(n))
