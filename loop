#Q1Write a script that prints the multiples of 7 between 0 and 100. 
Print one multiple per line and avoid printing any numbers that aren't multiples of 7. Remember that 0 is also a multiple of 7.

for x in range(0,100):
 if x%7==0:   #注意indented
  print(x)    #注意indented
  
#Question 2
Fill in the blanks to make the factorial function return the factorial of n. 
Then, print the first 10 factorials (from 0 to 9) with the corresponding number. 
Remember that the factorial of a number is defined as the product of an integer and all integers before it. 
For example, the factorial of five (5!) is equal to 1*2*3*4*5=120. Also recall that the factorial of zero (0!) is equal to 1.
def factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for x in range(1,n):
        result =result*n
        n=n-1
    return result

for n in range(0,10):
    print(n, factorial(n))

Q3: Question 3
The show_letters function should print out each letter of a word on a separate line. Fill in the blanks to make that happen
def show_letters(word):
	for x in (word):
		print(x)
show_letters("Hello")
# Should print one line per letter


Q4:Question 4
The counter function counts down from start to stop when start is bigger than stop, and counts up from start to stop otherwise. 
Fill in the blanks to make this work correctly.
def counter(start, stop):
	x = start
	if x > stop:
		return_string = "Counting down: "
		while x >= stop:
			return_string += str(x)
			if x>stop:
				return_string += ","
			x-=1
	else:
		return_string = "Counting up: "
		while x <= stop:
			return_string += str(x)
			if x<stop:
				return_string += ","
			x+=1
	return return_string

print(counter(1, 10)) # Should be "Counting up: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10"
print(counter(2, 1)) # Should be "Counting down: 2,1"
print(counter(5, 5)) # Should be "Counting up: 5"


#while loop
Q1 Question 1
Fill in the blanks of this code to print out the numbers 1 through 7.
number = 1
while number <= 7:
	print(number, end=" ")
	number+=1
