#quiz 4 Question 4
Fill in the empty function so that it returns the sum of all the divisors of a number, without including it. 
A divisor is a number that divides into another without a remainder.

def sum_divisors(n):
  i = 1
  sum = 0
  # Return the sum of all divisors of n, not including n
  while i<n:
   if n%i==0:
      sum += i
      i+=1
   else:
      i+=1
  return sum
  


print(sum_divisors(0))
# 0
print(sum_divisors(3)) # Should sum of 1
# 1
print(sum_divisors(36)) # Should sum of 1+2+3+4+6+9+12+18
# 55
print(sum_divisors(102)) # Should be sum of 2+3+6+17+34+51
# 114
